        <p>my hobby is catching insects. You might think bugs are gross, but belive me, they are cool. Think about it. bugs can do things we can't, like flying, stinging and climbing up things. Can you do that? You'd be crazy if you could. Ever since the day I learned about insects, I was hooked. They fascinated me. So to this day I continue to look deeply into nature and try to see something new every day. </p>
